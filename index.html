        <h4>A community-centric Minecraft 1.17 SMP with tons of QoL tweaks!</h3>

        <p>That's probably the best way we can sum up the server. Firestarter is primarily a survival realm with an economy aspect to it. It's a community-driven SMP that was founded in August of 2019, aiming to create an experience that complements vanilla Minecraft and creates lasting memories!</p>  
        <p>We aim to create an uncluttered and straightforward experience without tons of unnecessary bells and whistles- simplicity is a central focus! Our simple rules prohibit griefing and protect your builds from disaster.</p>
        <p>Our economy is player-based, meaning players can create their own shops and warps, auction off items at their own prices, and trade with other players. We also have a polished jobs systems where players are able to earn money for playing the game whilst also leveling their abilities!</p>
        <p>Our current map, which has a 100k x 100k border, has been around since 1.14.2 and upgraded all the way to 1.17.1. We have tons of massive and impressive builds all over this map, all accessible with our player warps system! Check out our featured warps section in the warps menu to view the finest builds the server has to offer!</p>

        <p>We're currently running Minecraft 1.17.1, the Nether Update! Come join us at <code>firestartermc.com</code>.</p>
