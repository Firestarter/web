        <h3>Firestarter</h1>
        <h4>A community-centric Minecraft 1.16 SMP with tons of QoL tweaks!</h3>
        <br/>
        <hr>
        <p>That's probably the best way we can sum up the server. Firestarter is primarily a survival realm with an economy aspect to it. It's a community-driven SMP that was founded in August of 2019, aiming to create an experience that complements vanilla Minecraft and creates lasting memories!</p>  
        <p>We aim to create an uncluttered and straightforward experience without tons of unnecessary bells and whistles. Our simple rules prohibit griefing and protect your builds from disaster.</p>
        <p>Our economy is player-based, meaning players can create their own shops and warps, auction off items at their own prices, and trade with other players. We also have a polished jobs systems where players are able to earn money for playing the game whilst also leveling their abilities!</p>
    
        <p>We're currently running Minecraft 1.16.5, the Nether Update! Come join us at <code>firestartermc.com</code>.</p>
